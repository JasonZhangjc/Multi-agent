# Classified Multiagent Planning in Different Regions
This is a demo of the multiagent project in which we model a multiagent system 
under counting linear temporal logic specifications and run its simulation. 
The map of the system is divided into different regions. And in each region, 
agents are divided into two classes.

Required packages:
 1. Yalmip (Matlab API) (https://yalmip.github.io/)
 2. Gurobi (Matlab API) (http://www.gurobi.com/)
 
To run the project:
 1. Go to ex directory.
 2. Run My_example_region.m or region.m.
 3. You can modify the "horizon" according to your demand.

This project is still under development.
